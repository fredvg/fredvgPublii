Not the ambitious, climb-the-ladder kind. The other kind — jobs that sound genuinely pleasant to do day-to-day, even if they might never happen.</p><p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words">First up: farmer at Park Hill Orchard.</p><p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words">Picture this: The bulk of the work would be outside. Tending to the orchard, mowing grass, maintaining pathways and infrastructure. Seventy-five percent of my time spent with my hands in the dirt or on a tractor. There's something appealing about work that's tangible and seasonal. You plant, you tend, you harvest. You literally see and can touch the results!</p><p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words">The rest of my time could be split between their digital presence — keeping the website and social media updated — and working on branding. Signage, visual merchandising, maybe nudging the brand toward an Americana, New England aesthetic that's admittedly a bit cliche for orchards like this but still a great fit.</p><p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words">Why I think this would be a dream: I can bike there year round, it's about a mile up the road from where I live. As an added bonus, I'd be working with a view of Mt. Tom all day. Did I mention they have an Art in the Orchard program? I'd love to help coordinate that — bringing together art, community, and agriculture. How's that for real-world experience and creativity?</p><p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words">Unfortunately, most dreams end with rude awakenings. I'm pretty sure they can't pay me what I'd need to provide for the family and maintain our current lifestyle. Health insurance and benefits are likely off the table. And that's not even considering the fact that they'd need to understand the value of having someone help with their marketing and branding. Most small farms see that work as a luxury, not a necessity.</p><p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words">I said it was a dream job, didn't I? But it's fun to dream about a job where the work is split between physical, creative, and digital. Where you're outside most of the day. Where the product is something people actually want and can touch, not another app or service they need to stare at a screen for.</p><p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words">Maybe I'll start a series of these. Dream jobs I'll never have but like thinking about anyway.</p></div></article></main></div><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p class="align-center">© 2024-25 | Frederik Van Geloven</p><p class="align-center">Sign up with <a href="/feed.xml">RSS</a> | Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com/" class="extlink extlink-icon-1">Publii</a></p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://fredvg.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://fredvg.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
