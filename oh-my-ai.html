There are many things about it I don’t like. Even the basic premise, that this technology is intelligent doesn’t match my definition of the term. Real intelligence requires more than connecting a bunch of data points. Sure, it can create things from scratch, and it’s great at recognizing and replicating patterns. But is that creativity, or can we consider that<i> thinking</i>? I don’t believe it is. And yes, believe is the word I meant to use. Because the definition of these terms — intelligence, creativity, thinking — is somewhat subjective.</span></p><p class="p1 msg msg--highlight"><span class="s1">Aside: I know these words have clear definitions and meanings. But some words can’t be perfectly described. Don’t worry, I won’t get into my philosophy of semiotics here. Back to the main topic!</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">So yes, I generally dislike AI. You can read all about the environmental concerns, ethical issues, and potential apocalyptic consequences elsewhere.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The reality is, AI is unavoidable now. And — as a digital designer — it’s (part of) my job to keep up with it.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the ways I’ve been experimenting, is collaborating on posts here. I used some of my older posts to train an LLM assistant (I used Claude, but I believe they are all pretty much interchangeable when it comes to this). It did a decent job at capturing my voice and tone. Which, I have to admit, was a bit unsettling and cringe-worthy. It’s like looking back at older work. Except AI tends to amplify things, which makes the way the assistant writes almost a caricature of my style.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the things it learned about me is that I often start with a musing or by asking the reader a question. Which is true, but … Actually, hold that thought. I’ll get back to it.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">After my robot friend — JK, it’s a bunch of 1s and 0s, not a friend — had learned to write in my voice, I gave it an outline for the <a href="https://fredvg.com/dream-job-park-hill-orchard-farmer.html">Dreamjob: Parkhill Orchard Farmer</a> post. The results weren’t terrible but definitely needed editing. I tried to only do a light edit because I wanted to use it as an example of my experimenting.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you read the post, you might notice how often my AI assistant and I ask the reader a question. I’d like to think I’m less heavy-handed with that stylistic technique. It also amplified and over-used some of my other signature moves. It’s hard for me to judge how easy it is for someone to notice that the writing isn’t 100% mine. I would hope you notice, but I’m afraid you might not.</span></p><p class="p1 msg msg--highlight"><span class="s1"><strong>TLDR:</strong> AI is helpful, and can already save time and effort. And because of the way it works, it’ll continue to get better. I worry that it’ll always stay somewhat formulaic though. Is it intelligent? Or can it be trusted to work on its own? I don’t yet think so, and I’m not sure we’ll ever get there. If we do, we’ll have bigger things to worry about. Our <em>intelligence</em> is what put us at the top of the food chain. Guess who will take our spot once it's able to <em>outthink </em>us.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">PS: I did <em>not</em> co-write this post with AI. So far I’ve only used it for the Dreamjob postings. For transparency, AI experiments are tagged with the <a href="https://fredvg.com/tags/ai-assist/">AI-assist tag</a>.</span></p></div></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2025-05-07T17:31" class="feed__date">May 7, 2025</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://fredvg.com/ux-writing-tip-link-text.html">UX writing tip: link text</a></h3></header><p>I just posted a free (!) <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fredvg_heres-a-quick-tip-i-almost-didnt-share-activity-7325990021771980803-csg9?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAACERWUsBPK8RpvmUBitzlnFGnjETdcxlZ_U" class="extlink extlink-icon-1">UX writing tip to LinkedIn</a>.
