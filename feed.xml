                <p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words">With all the volatility that's been going on at work, I've been thinking about dream jobs lately. Not the ambitious, climb-the-ladder kind. The other kind — jobs that sound genuinely pleasant to do day-to-day, even if they might never happen.</p>
<p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words">First up: farmer at Park Hill Orchard.</p>
<p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words">Picture this: The bulk of the work would be outside. Tending to the orchard, mowing grass, maintaining pathways and infrastructure. Seventy-five percent of my time spent with my hands in the dirt or on a tractor. There's something appealing about work that's tangible and seasonal. You plant, you tend, you harvest. You literally see and can touch the results!</p>
<p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words">The rest of my time could be split between their digital presence — keeping the website and social media updated — and working on branding. Signage, visual merchandising, maybe nudging the brand toward an Americana, New England aesthetic that's admittedly a bit cliche for orchards like this but still a great fit.</p>
<p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words">Why I think this would be a dream: I can bike there year round, it's about a mile up the road from where I live. As an added bonus, I'd be working with a view of Mt. Tom all day. Did I mention they have an Art in the Orchard program? I'd love to help coordinate that — bringing together art, community, and agriculture. How's that for real-world experience and creativity?</p>
<p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words">Unfortunately, most dreams end with rude awakenings. I'm pretty sure they can't pay me what I'd need to provide for the family and maintain our current lifestyle. Health insurance and benefits are likely off the table. And that's not even considering the fact that they'd need to understand the value of having someone help with their marketing and branding. Most small farms see that work as a luxury, not a necessity.</p>
<p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words">I said it was a dream job, didn't I? But it's fun to dream about a job where the work is split between physical, creative, and digital. Where you're outside most of the day. Where the product is something people actually want and can touch, not another app or service they need to stare at a screen for.</p>
<p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words">Maybe I'll start a series of these. Dream jobs I'll never have but like thinking about anyway.</p>

                <p>Figma's built-in color contrast checker is so helpful! I used to rely on a few different plugins to check color contrast. Some of those had features Figma is missing, but I love how integrated the Figma tool is. The line and dotted pattern to indicate where the contrast falls below the standard you are checking for is such a great feature. Of course there's room for improvement. And Figma has a long way to go before they can claim to be front-runners when it comes to accessibility features. But this seemingly small feature, is a huge step in the right direction.</p>

                <p>The morning of November 6th 2024, I told my partner Laura: "This isn't just horrible news <em>in general</em>, it's probably going to cost me my job".</p>
<p>Turns out <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/stacyrobison_whenxanthi-scrimgeourand-i-started-communicatehealth-activity-7362135753415446528-FTnA">that was true</a>.</p>
<p>So, as I prepare for what's next, I'm officially "open to work". As you — probably — know, since you are reading this on my personal website, I'm a digital product designer. My primary focus is user experience design and strategy. But my skills extend to UI design, UX writing, content strategy, and more.</p>
<p class="whitespace-normal break-words">I'm drawn to companies and nonprofits using design and technology to combat misinformation, increase accessibility, promote equity, or any mission where thoughtful design can help create a more just and informed society.</p>
<p>I lost the job I loved — working towards a mission I believe in — to mistrust in science and a war on DEI. But I'm not about to give up what I believe in. If you are working towards making the internet a force for good in the world, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fredvg">please get in touch</a>.
