                <p>I consider myself a modernist. My sense of aesthetic leans clean and simple. Think Bauhaus, Swiss Design, and maybe a hint of Scandinavian or Japanese minimalism.</p>
<p>At the same time, I'm a sucker for "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gezelligheid">gezelligheid</a>". That's the Dutch word for cosiness or "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygge">hygge</a>" if you will. I have fond memories of playing with my LEGO in the living room, while <a href="https://youtu.be/284y4oDmvJw?si=hfneiTBFGUkvA_5t">Countdown</a> is on the TV and my mom is preparing dinner in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Now, as a grown-up, I love sitting by the fire with a book, a glass of scotch, and a jazz record playing in the background. A cliché, I know, but good old <em>gezelligheid is </em>inevitably nostalgic and a bit cliché.</p>
<p>Newness, innovation, and forward-thinking don't jive well with coziness. At least not by my definition.</p>
<p>My want for a kind of old-timey ambiance is what led me to stay at the <a href="https://www.redlioninn.com/history">Red Lion Inn</a> for 2 nights in the dead of New England winter.</p>
<p>The Red Lion Inn is old. As in, 250+ years old. If you are looking for a blingy kind of luxury, this place is not it. It's got history, character, and cosiness in abandon. But it's not fancy. It's not a grand hotel. Think Great Northern Hotel from Twin Peaks, but older and maybe a bit more treadbare. I gotta say though, it's really <em>gezellig</em> to sit here by the fire in the lobby, and write this post while listening to classical music and the comings and goings of other guests.</p>
<p>PS: As I was writing this post and thinking of my favorite show of all time (Twin Peaks), I found out that David Lynch has passed away. Thanks for all the great works of art you left us with, Mr. Lynch.</p>

                <p>Snowy runs are awesome. It was snowing during my morning run today and there was about an inch or two of fresh snow on the ground. I ran through neighborhoods, forest, and farm roads and it was beautiful. I don't bring my phone when I run, so the picture below is from a different day. It just illustrates nicely why I like running in snow.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://youtu.be/EevTIUCJco4?si=BhiNwEoqZIBLOIaq">"Church of the long run"</a> video by Tracksmith tells the story of winter running in an amazing way. It's one of my favorite YouTube videos and marketing pieces ever.</p>

                <p>Not that anyone cares, but I'm back on the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">indieweb</a>. Who, what, why?! Yes, all good questions.</p>
<p>In my — admittedly personal — definition, the indieweb is the equivalent of mom-and-pop shops for the web. In other words, instead of publishing to large social media platforms, or maintaining a web presence through a proprietary system like Squarespace, I'm taking ownership of my personal website.</p>
<p>As a <em>web-professional</em> I've had a personal website for the last 25 years. Over the years, my website has lived in a variety of places (URLs) and has been created in a variety of platforms. The last few years though, it has mostly been a very basic (hand-rolled) one-page website.</p>
<p>Also in recent years, I've stopped publishing to social media. Unhappy with how Meta was (is) run, I deleted my Facebook account years ago. This was an entirely futile and even hypocritical move. No one cares whether I have a Facebook account or not. I quit Twitter when Musk bought it. At the time, I switched to Mastodon, but I never really used it.</p>
<p>Other platforms I have accounts for — some of which I've even posted to — are YouTube, Substack, Pinterest, and Tumblr (owned by WordPress). Most of these have had their share of controversy. And even when they are not actively trying to make the world a worse place, they are still for profit — mostly advertising-driven — businesses. Which means they'll try to keep me scrolling for as long as possible while they try to sell me things or ideas I don't want or need.</p>
<p>I much prefer to spend time online outside of the control of algorithms. I'm one of the few people who still relies heavily on RSS, and very much appreciate when people take the time to maintain an <em>indieweb</em> online presence.</p>
<p>So to put my money where my mouth is. Or rather, to spend my time where my people are, my resolution for 2025 is to keep this website updated and to publish whatever I feel like sharing here.</p>
<p>I also plan to ressurect the idea of a <em>blogroll</em>, and share other indiewebsites I like. More on that soon.</p>
<p>For now, thanks for reading! Let me know if you have your own website you'd like me to check out.</p>
