                <p>The morning of November 6th 2024, I told my partner Laura: "This isn't just horrible news <em>in general</em>, it's probably going to cost me my job".</p>
<p>Turns out <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/stacyrobison_whenxanthi-scrimgeourand-i-started-communicatehealth-activity-7362135753415446528-FTnA">that was true</a>.</p>
<p>So, as I prepare for what's next, I'm officially "open to work". As you — probably — know, since you are reading this on my personal website, I'm a digital product designer. My primary focus is user experience design and strategy. But my skills extend to UI design, UX writing, content strategy, and more.</p>
<p class="whitespace-normal break-words">I'm drawn to companies and nonprofits using design and technology to combat misinformation, increase accessibility, promote equity, or any mission where thoughtful design can help create a more just and informed society.</p>
<p>I lost the job I loved — working towards a mission I believe in — to mistrust in science and a war on DEI. But I'm not about to give up what I believe in. If you are working towards making the internet a force for good in the world, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fredvg">please get in touch</a>. I'd love to chat about how we can help each other.</p>

                    <p>Does listening to an audiobook count as "reading"? I'm not sure it does. Either way, I listened to Craig Mod reading his (audio)book <a href="https://craigmod.com/books/things_become_other_things/">Things Become Other Things</a> while working in the yard. Craig made the opposite move from me, he emigrated from the US. I immigrated here instead. It felt perfectly appropriate to listen to Craig's story while tending to my little suburban piece of America.</p>
<p>Go give it a listen, or read the actual book. I highly recommend it. If you listen to the audiobook, don't miss the photos, they're in the <em>extras</em>.</p>
