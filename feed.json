Some of those had features Figma is missing, but I love how integrated the Figma tool is. The line and dotted pattern to indicate where the contrast falls below the standard you are checking for is such a great feature. Of course there's room for improvement. And Figma has a long way to go before they can claim to be front-runners when it comes to accessibility features. But this seemingly small feature, is a huge step in the right direction.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://fredvg.com/media/posts/29/Figma-Color-Contrast-Checker.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of the Figma color picker tool with built-in contrast checker.\" width=\"1402\" height=\"1014\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://fredvg.com/media/posts/29/responsive/Figma-Color-Contrast-Checker-xs.png 640w ,https://fredvg.com/media/posts/29/responsive/Figma-Color-Contrast-Checker-sm.png 768w ,https://fredvg.com/media/posts/29/responsive/Figma-Color-Contrast-Checker-md.png 1024w ,https://fredvg.com/media/posts/29/responsive/Figma-Color-Contrast-Checker-lg.png 1366w ,https://fredvg.com/media/posts/29/responsive/Figma-Color-Contrast-Checker-xl.png 1600w ,https://fredvg.com/media/posts/29/responsive/Figma-Color-Contrast-Checker-2xl.png 1920w\"></figure>",
