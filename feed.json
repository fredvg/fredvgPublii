As you — probably — know, since you are reading this on my personal website, I'm a digital product designer. My primary focus is user experience design and strategy. But my skills extend to UI design, UX writing, content strategy, and more.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">I'm drawn to companies and nonprofits using design and technology to combat misinformation, increase accessibility, promote equity, or any mission where thoughtful design can help create a more just and informed society.</p>\n<p>I lost the job I loved — working towards a mission I believe in — to mistrust in science and a war on DEI. But I'm not about to give up what I believe in. If you are working towards making the internet a force for good in the world, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/fredvg\">please get in touch</a>. I'd love to chat about how we can help each other.</p>",
