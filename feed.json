That's the Dutch word for cosiness or \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygge\">hygge</a>\" if you will. I have fond memories of playing with my LEGO in the living room, while <a href=\"https://youtu.be/284y4oDmvJw?si=hfneiTBFGUkvA_5t\">Countdown</a> is on the TV and my mom is preparing dinner in the kitchen.</p>\n<p>Now, as a grown-up, I love sitting by the fire with a book, a glass of scotch, and a jazz record playing in the background. A cliché, I know, but good old <em>gezelligheid is </em>inevitably nostalgic and a bit cliché.</p>\n<p>Newness, innovation, and forward-thinking don't jive well with coziness. At least not by my definition.</p>\n<p>My want for a kind of old-timey ambiance is what led me to stay at the <a href=\"https://www.redlioninn.com/history\">Red Lion Inn</a> for 2 nights in the dead of New England winter.</p>\n<p>The Red Lion Inn is old. As in, 250+ years old. If you are looking for a blingy kind of luxury, this place is not it. It's got history, character, and cosiness in abandon. But it's not fancy. It's not a grand hotel. Think Great Northern Hotel from Twin Peaks, but older and maybe a bit more treadbare. I gotta say though, it's really <em>gezellig</em> to sit here by the fire in the lobby, and write this post while listening to classical music and the comings and goings of other guests.</p>\n<p>PS: As I was writing this post and thinking of my favorite show of all time (Twin Peaks), I found out that David Lynch has passed away. Thanks for all the great works of art you left us with, Mr. Lynch.</p>",
