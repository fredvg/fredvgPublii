Think wool singlets and split shorts that wouldn't look out of place in a 1970s marathon, but designed for today. They're based in Boston, about two hours from me.</p><p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words">The job would split three ways. Half my time on UX/UI/interaction design — they already do excellent work here, so I'd be taking things from excellent to extraordinary. A quarter of my time on service design and marketing strategy, looking at their processes and experiences across online shopping, in-store sales, their flagship locations, and the many events they organize. The final quarter would be logistics — helping at photo shoots, events, interfacing with their running club members.</p><p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words">Why this appeals: They're a super cool brand that feels perfectly aligned with my personal aesthetic and values. Quintessentially New England. I've been running three days a week for the past few years, and I've come to see it as a mindfulness practice. Some of their marketing leans into that too — their <a href="https://www.tracksmith.com/journal/article/church-of-the-long-run-film" class="extlink extlink-icon-1">Church of the Long Run</a> video captures exactly what I mean about running as meditation. And finally, there's something inspiring about working on a project that's already pretty great. You get a head start.</p><p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words">Why it might never happen: They're already doing well, so they might not need me. And if they do need me in Boston or at events, I'm looking at a two-hour-plus commute. I wouldn't be able to go into the office more than a couple times a month, which might not be enough. Still, they seem like a smart bunch, so they might be able to work with me on these hurdles (no pun intended).</p></div></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2025-11-14T17:30" class="feed__date">November 14, 2025</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://fredvg.com/dream-job-park-hill-orchard-farmer.html">Dream job: Park Hill Orchard Farmer</a></h3></header><p>With all the volatility that's been going on at work, I've been thinking about dream jobs lately.
