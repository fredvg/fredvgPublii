I work at <a href="https://luminacorps.com" class="extlink extlink-icon-1">Lumina Corps</a>.</p><p>In 1998, I made a website for a college class I took. I was hooked right away. After that, I continued to grow as a web professional, eventually focusing exclusively on digital design and user experience in 2011.</p><p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">I've created websites, mobile applications, and online services that have served millions of people. In 2016, while working for <a href="https://www.vermont.gov/" class="extlink extlink-icon-1">Vermont.gov</a> I designed and developed an award-winning Drupal CMS and design system that powers over 100 official government websites.<br></span></p><p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">In 2017, I joined the team at CommunicateHealth, where — after a few promotions — I became a UX design strategist. As the name implies, that's a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jmspool_heres-some-exciting-news-a-new-branch-of-activity-7422058353918554113-0npl/" class="extlink extlink-icon-1">strategic role</a>, but I still spend a good amount of time on design production tasks.</span></p><p>In 2026, CommunicateHealth and Lumina Corps joined forces under the Lumina Corps name.</p><p>In my current role, I've been fortunate to lead UX design for many high-impact and award-winning products. We are mission driven and work to improve lives by designing health information that's easy to understand and use. Here are a few of the things I've worked on — and I'm especially proud of:</p><ul><li>Increased traffic to <a href="https://healthypeople.gov" class="extlink extlink-icon-1" title="HealthyPeople 2030">HealthyPeople 2030</a> by over 100%, and made the information that's presented much easier to find, understand, and interpret.</li><li>Created <a href="https://lesturnerals.org/my-als-decision-tool/" class="extlink extlink-icon-1" title="Les Turner ALS Decision Tool">interactive decision aids</a> that make a real difference in the lives of people with ALS and their caregivers.</li><li>Led UX design for a <a href="https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/outreach-resources/see-what-i-see-virtual-reality-eye-disease-experience" class="extlink extlink-icon-1" title="NEI Virtual Reality App">virtual reality app</a> that allows people to experience what it's like to have eye diseases that affect vision.</li><li>Worked with — and for — veterans on <a href="https://www.ptsd.va.gov/apps/aboutface/" class="extlink extlink-icon-1" title="VA AboutFace">a website that helps them figure out if they might have PTSD</a> and what their next steps might be.</li><li>Helped thousands of people live healthier lives as they learn about <a href="https://odphp.health.gov/moveyourway/activity-planner" class="extlink extlink-icon-1" title="Move Your Way Activity Planner">physical activity</a>, or <a href="https://odphp.health.gov/moveyourway/stories" class="extlink extlink-icon-1" title="Move Your Way and DGA stories">dietary guidelines</a> and how to easily translate that knowledge into healthier choices.</li></ul><p>I believe strongly that good product design needs to be accessible, inclusive, and empathetic. If your product falls short, adoption and usage won't be where you need them to be — and that will ultimately impact the bottom line. Finding out you missed the target after launch is way too late. To avoid that, I follow an equity-centered design process, which is similar to human-centered design, but focuses even more on these three concepts. The best way to achieve this is by talking directly to the people we design for.</p><p>Human-centered and research-driven design always reveals interesting and complex needs. I love the challenge this poses and embrace the uncertainty it brings. The work is never done, and neither is the learning, but that’s exactly why I love this job.</p><p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">If you want to learn more about me, or about the things I care about, I'd love to tell you more.
